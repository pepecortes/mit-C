continue with assignement 5
remember the most common gcc options: gcc -g -Wall ass5.c -o ass5.o
-g is necessary to keep the symbols table in the object file and then allow debugging.
gcc debugging. howto set a breakpoint: break source.c:line
tutorial simple de gdb: http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/gdbtoc.html
next: I am doing btree. the talloc function is done. before going on, learn the background of the btree.

07/09/13
spent time setting github and git
studied binary tree: see wikipedia "search binary tree"
addnode is done. the preorder function only displays the last item: weak in recursion?

08/09/13
preorder fixed: as usual in recursion, focus on designing the function
considering that it was already designed.
the rest of the exercise is straight forward.

started with assignment 6a. infix_to_postfix function. does not work because not understanding  p_expr_token (pointer or what?)
note that i have modified evaluate to be able to test my function, but the display function is not yet created: what a bordel!
